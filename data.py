    tn ="Tantra is the place where people go to make up for missed meals (this is getting clich√©, but again, much more common than you think). It's the only place which sells meal-sized portions, but its menu has some interesting typos - 'chicken moms' among them."

    bb = "BBC Maggi and Dosa are known campus-wide. This may seem like less variety to you, but the sheer number of permutations and combinations within these to tap into will ensure that you're never bored."
